# Python-Challenge-HW-3
Data Bootcamp Week 3 HW - Python
This week's challenge was to do a financial analysis of PyBank using python code. 
I used Xpert Learning Assistant and followed along with the instructor during office hours.
My code isn't right as I did not get the results that are on the challenge page.

For PyPoll, the challenge was to use python code to count votes and determine a winner.  
I kept getting an error message. So there is no output from the code.

I copied and pasted my code into a text file as I couldn't get it to do so using python.
